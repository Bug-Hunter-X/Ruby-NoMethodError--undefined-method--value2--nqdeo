# Ruby NoMethodError Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ruby: the `NoMethodError`.  This occurs when a method is called on an object, but the object does not have a method defined with that name.  The example code attempts to access a nonexistent attribute, leading to this error.  The solution showcases how to handle this error gracefully and avoid it in the future.
